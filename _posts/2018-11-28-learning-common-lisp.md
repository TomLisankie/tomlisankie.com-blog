I decided that I&#8217;m gonna learn [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)&nbsp;in monthly intervals. Every day that I don&#8217;t publish something on it in [this repository](https://github.com/TomLisankie/Learning-Lisp) this month, I will send the first five people to inform me on Twitter each $5 per missed blog post. I published the first post in the series [here](https://github.com/TomLisankie/Learning-Lisp/blob/master/posts/Nov2018/27.md) today which details why I&#8217;m doing this, setting up my CL environment, and basic CL syntax.

I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;ll learn either Clojure or Julia next. No reason to put the cart before the horse though. I just can&#8217;t help myself, new languages are exciting!

Maybe I&#8217;ll post a reflection piece here once I&#8217;m done with this month.
